Apache Flex (FlexUnit)
==================

Apache Flex (FlexUnit) is a unit testing framework for Apache Flex and ActionScript 3.0 
applications and libraries. It mimics the functionality of JUnit, a Java 
unit testing framework, and comes with a graphical test runner.

Getting the latest sources via git
==================================

    You can always checkout the latest source via git using the following
    command:
	
	 git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/flex-flexunit.git flexunit
	 cd flexunit
	 git checkout develop

    For further information visit http://flex.apache.org/download-source.html

Building Apache Flex (FlexUnit)
=========================

    Apache Flex (FlexUnit) requires some build tools which must be installed
    prior to building FlexUnit and it depends on some external software which
    are downloaded as part of the build process.  Some of these have different licenses.
    See the Software Dependencies section for more information on the external software
    dependencies.
	
Install Prerequisites
---------------------

    Before building FlexUnit you must install the following software and set the
    corresponding environment variables using absolute file paths.  Relative file paths
    will result in build errors.
    
	==================================================================================
    SOFTWARE                                    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE (absolute paths)
    ==================================================================================
    
    Java SDK 1.6 or greater (*1)                JAVA_HOME
        (for Java 1.7 see note at (*2))
        
    Ant 1.7.1 or greater (*1)                   ANT_HOME
        (for Java 1.7 see note at (*2))
    
    Apache Flex (*3)                            FLEX_HOME 
    
    ==================================================================================
	
	*1) The bin directories for ANT_HOME and JAVA_HOME should be added to your PATH.
        
        On Windows, set PATH to
            
            PATH=%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin
            
        On the Mac (bash), set PATH to
            
            export PATH="$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin"
            
         On Linux make sure you path include ANT_HOME and JAVA_HOME.

    *2)  If you are using Java SDK 1.7 or greater on a Mac you must use Ant 1.8 or 
         greater. If you use Java 1.7 with Ant 1.7, ant reports the java version as 1.6 
         so the JVM args for the data model (-d32/-d64) will not be set correctly and
         you will get compile errors.
        
    *3) FLEX_HOME should be set to a valid Apache Flex installation.

    Apache Flex (FlexUnit) uses third-party code that will be downloaded as part of the Apache
    Flex (FlexUnit) build.  

    When you have all the prerequisites in place and the environment variables set, 
    (see Install Prerequisites above), use

        cd <flexunit.dir>
        ant thirdparty-downloads
			
	TODO a list of all thirdparty libraries
